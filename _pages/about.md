I am a researcher at [St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL)](https://cse.umn.edu/safl), University of Minnesota, working in the [Fluid Mechanics Lab](https://fluids.umn.edu/) led by Prof. [Lian Shen](https://cse.umn.edu/me/lian-shen). I obtained my Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research centers on **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, developing high-fidelity numerical simulation tools and applying them to fundamental and applied problems in fluid mechanics. Current research directions include:

- **Multiphase flow** — ventilated cavitation, air-water-oil interface dynamics, level set and volume of fluid methods
- **Turbulence** — compressible turbulence, large-eddy simulation (LES), Richtmyer-Meshkov instability and mixing
- **Particle-laden flow** — preferential concentration, Stokes number effects in compressible turbulence
- **Fluid-structure interaction** — flexible aquatic canopy flows, hydrokinetic turbine design and optimization
- **Quantum-inspired computing for fluids** — tensor network methods for Navier-Stokes equations, variational quantum algorithms

My work spans from fundamental turbulence physics to practical engineering applications such as [COVID-19 airborne transmission simulation](/projects/covid19/), [oil spill dynamics in breaking waves](/projects/oil_spills/), and [renewable energy systems](/projects/turbine/).
